Files for testing large scale simulations of Traub 2005 network model.

Alpha code!!!

Subject to change without notification!!

These files will probably be moved to the parent folder when stable.


    Quick instructions:

Run makeSyn.sh to generate the Syn_AMPA_... etc. folders in the ../../cellMechanism folder
If you're running Windows, convert this file to makeSyn.bat by running "python makeSynsBat.py" first

If you've made any changes to the network in the netConnList file, update the neuroConstruct project using "python genNetConns.py",
but the checked in project should already be consistent with this list.

Use "nC.sh -python GenNetworkParallel.py" to generate the network for different scalings and send it to your chosen cluster/etc.
